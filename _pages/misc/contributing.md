Having trouble understanding something? Found a typo in the content? Interested in adding information or helping to [clarify a section](https://github.com/FRCDoneRight/FIRSTCompendium/issues)? Then by all means [submit an issue](https://github.com/FRCDoneRight/FIRSTCompendium/issues/new) or [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). If this is your first pull request, it may be helpful to read up on the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) first.

The FIRST Compendium has been designed as an all-encompassing resource to help create and grow FIRST teams from all levels of play. Please keep this in mind when requesting features and/or submitting pull requests. Most anything is welcome, but if it's not something useful to more than one team it will not be accepted. When in doubt, please ask!

## Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a branch off of `master` and give it a meaningful name (e.g. `my-awesome-new-page`) and describe the feature or fix.
3. Open a pull request on GitHub.

All source files for pages can be found in the [`/_pages`](https://github.com/{{ site.repository }}/blob/master/_pages) folder if you'd like to tackle any "low-hanging fruit" like fixing typos, bad grammar, etc.
