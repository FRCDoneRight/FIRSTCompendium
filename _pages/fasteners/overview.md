## Materials
Fasteners are available in a wide range of materials including stainless steel, steel, bronze, brass, and aluminum. Stainless steel fasteners are non-magnetic, but are otherwise more expensive (18-8, 316 and 410). Carbon steel fasteners are the most common and come with various surface treatments (zinc plating, galvanization, chrome plating). Carbon steel fasteners are sold in different grade ratings to indicate their strength. Alloy steel fasteners made from high strength steel that has been heat treated, they are not plated and have a dull black finish. There is very little use for bronze, or brass fasteners in FRC. Aluminum fasteners are only used for rivets.
For general use my recommendation is to use alloy steel bolts, and nylon insert zinc plated steel locknuts. For the smaller fasteners used in FRC, these materials are very adequate, and are typically the most cost effective when buying boxes of 100.

## Nuts
Nylon insert hex lock nuts are ideal for first robotics. They install with very reasonable force, and won't vibrate off. They are reusable several times, and come off easily. If you encounter a bolt and nut that don't thread easily, you may have found a mixed standard (bolt and nut have different thread standards.)
When bolting soft material (Plastic, Composites) a washer should be used to distribute the load and not crush the material.

### Other Fasteners Types

There are some additional bolted fasteners that may be useful in your designs.
Machine screws are self-tapping small fasteners that can be used for attaching small objects to sheet metal.
